Assignment One - Health Professional Appointment System
--------------------------------------------------------

How to Compile and Run:

1. Open your Java IDE (such as IntelliJ, Eclipse, or VS Code).
2. Make sure all the `.java` files are in the same project or folder:
   - HealthProfessional.java
   - GeneralPractitioner.java
   - Dietitian.java
   - Appointment.java
   - AssignmentOne.java
3. Compile and run the AssignmentOne.java file.
   - This is the main file containing the main() method.

Expected Output:

- The program prints details of 3 General Practitioners and 2 Dietitians.
- Then it creates 4 patient appointments and prints their details.
- One appointment is cancelled (Jacob Lee), and the updated list is printed again.

Note:

- The program demonstrates the use of inheritance, object-oriented design, array lists, and basic class interactions.
